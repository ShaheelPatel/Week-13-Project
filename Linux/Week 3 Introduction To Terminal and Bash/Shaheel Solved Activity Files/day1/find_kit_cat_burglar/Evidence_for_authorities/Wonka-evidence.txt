Dear Ruth,

 I dont think that anyone at Wonka is on to our plan, I just heard that Slugworth may offer us a million dollars for the gumdrops recipe.

 Sincerely,
 Henry

Ingredients
5 to 6 cups confectioners' sugar
2 cups sugar
3/4 cup light corn syrup
1/2 cup water
1 to 2 teaspoons anise, lemon or orange extract
Red, yellow or orange liquid food coloring


Fill a 15x10x1-in. pan with confectioners' sugar to a depth of 1/2 in.  make a continuous curved-line indentation in the sugar; set pan aside.
In a large heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, corn syrup and water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Cover and continue cooking for 3 minutes to dissolve any sugar crystals.
Uncover and cook on medium-high heat, without stirring, until a candy thermometer reads 300Â° (hard-crack stage). Remove from the heat; stir in extract and food coloring if desired.
Carefully pour into a glass measuring cup. Working quickly, pour into prepared indentation in pan. Cover candy with confectioners' sugar. When candy is cool enough to handle, cut into pieces with a scissors. Store in a covered container.
Ingredients

2 cups white sugar
1/4 teaspoon 
salt
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup finely chopped almonds

Directions


In a large heavy bottomed saucepan, combine the butter, sugar and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring until the butter is melted. Allow to come to a boil, and cook until the mixture becomes a dark amber color, and the temperature has reached 285 degrees F (137 degrees C). Stir occasionally.
While the toffee is cooking, cover a large baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper.
As soon as the toffee reaches the proper temperature, pour it out onto the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle the chocolate over the top, and let it set for a minute or two to soften. Spread the chocolate into a thin even layer once it is melted. Sprinkle the nuts over the chocolate, and press in slightly. Putting a plastic bag over your hand will minimize the mess.
Place the toffee in the refrigerator to chill until set. Break into pieces, and store in an airtight container.
